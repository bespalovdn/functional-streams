# functional-streams

This library provides the model and small set of tools 
to deal with async IO in functional style, without inversion of control.

**functional-streams** was created to eliminate complexities accompanying
with implementation the client/server async request-response protocols.

**functional-streams** is not dedicated to some concrete protocol or 
implementation. It's just a model, which provides abilities to create
layered architecture for request/response processing code. As a result
the code becomes easy to read, easy to extend, and easy to test.
